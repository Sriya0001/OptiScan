# Keratoconus Detection using Classical Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on the **early detection and classification of keratoconus** based on corneal images.  
It applies **classical machine learning techniques** on extracted image features to classify between normal and keratoconus cases.

## Features
- Data preprocessing with **OpenCV** and **scikit-image**
- Feature extraction: **HOG, LBP, GLCM**
- Dimensionality reduction with **PCA**
- Models: **Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost**
- Evaluation: **Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report**
- Handles **class imbalance** using `imbalanced-learn`

## Results

Achieved strong classification performance with classical ML.

XGBoost and SVM gave competitive results.

PCA reduced dimensionality while preserving accuracy.

Key visualizations include feature maps and confusion matrices.

## Future Work

Extend to deep learning (CNNs) for higher accuracy

Deploy as a Flask/Streamlit web app

Automate preprocessing pipeline for clinical usability
